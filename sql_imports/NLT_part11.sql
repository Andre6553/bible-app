(59, 3, 6, 'But Christ, the faithful Son, was in charge of the entire household. And we are God''s household, if we keep up our courage and remain confident in our hope in Christ.', 'NLT'),
(59, 3, 7, 'That is why the Holy Spirit says, "Today you must listen to his voice.', 'NLT'),
(59, 3, 8, 'Don''t harden your hearts against him as Israel did when they rebelled, when they tested God''s patience in the wilderness.', 'NLT'),
(59, 3, 9, 'There your ancestors tried my patience, even though they saw my miracles for forty years.', 'NLT'),
(59, 3, 10, 'So I was angry with them, and I said, ''Their hearts always turn away from me. They refuse to do what I tell them.''', 'NLT'),
(59, 3, 11, 'So in my anger I made a vow: ''They will never enter my place of rest.''"', 'NLT'),
(59, 3, 12, 'Be careful then, dear brothers and sisters. Make sure that your own hearts are not evil and unbelieving, turning you away from the living God.', 'NLT'),
(59, 3, 13, 'You must warn each other every day, as long as it is called "today," so that none of you will be deceived by sin and hardened against God.', 'NLT'),
(59, 3, 14, 'For if we are faithful to the end, trusting God just as firmly as when we first believed, we will share in all that belongs to Christ.', 'NLT'),
(59, 3, 15, 'But never forget the warning: "Today you must listen to his voice. Don''t harden your hearts against him as Israel did when they rebelled."', 'NLT'),
(59, 3, 16, 'And who were those people who rebelled against God, even though they heard his voice? Weren''t they the ones Moses led out of Egypt?', 'NLT'),
(59, 3, 17, 'And who made God angry for forty years? Wasn''t it the people who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?', 'NLT'),
(59, 3, 18, 'And to whom was God speaking when he vowed that they would never enter his place of rest? He was speaking to those who disobeyed him.', 'NLT'),
(59, 3, 19, 'So we see that they were not allowed to enter his rest because of their unbelief.', 'NLT'),
(59, 4, 1, 'God''s promise of entering his place of rest still stands, so we ought to tremble with fear that some of you might fail to get there.', 'NLT'),
(59, 4, 2, 'For this Good News--that God has prepared a place of rest--has been announced to us just as it was to them. But it did them no good because they didn''t believe what God told them.', 'NLT'),
(59, 4, 3, 'For only we who believe can enter his place of rest. As for those who didn''t believe, God said, "In my anger I made a vow: ''They will never enter my place of rest,''" even though his place of rest has been ready since he made the world.', 'NLT'),
(59, 4, 4, 'We know it is ready because the Scriptures mention the seventh day, saying, "On the seventh day God rested from all his work."', 'NLT'),
(59, 4, 5, 'But in the other passage God said, "They will never enter my place of rest."', 'NLT'),
(59, 4, 6, 'So God''s rest is there for people to enter. But those who formerly heard the Good News failed to enter because they disobeyed God.', 'NLT'),
(59, 4, 7, 'So God set another time for entering his place of rest, and that time is today. God announced this through David a long time later in the words already quoted: "Today you must listen to his voice. Don''t harden your hearts against him."', 'NLT'),
(59, 4, 8, 'This new place of rest was not the land of Canaan, where Joshua led them. If it had been, God would not have spoken later about another day of rest.', 'NLT'),
(59, 4, 9, 'So there is a special rest still waiting for the people of God.', 'NLT'),
(59, 4, 10, 'For all who enter into God''s rest will find rest from their labors, just as God rested after creating the world.', 'NLT'),
(59, 4, 11, 'Let us do our best to enter that place of rest. For anyone who disobeys God, as the people of Israel did, will fall.', 'NLT'),
(59, 4, 12, 'For the word of God is full of living power. It is sharper than the sharpest knife, cutting deep into our innermost thoughts and desires. It exposes us for what we really are.', 'NLT'),
(59, 4, 13, 'Nothing in all creation can hide from him. Everything is naked and exposed before his eyes. This is the God to whom we must explain all that we have done.', 'NLT'),
(59, 4, 14, 'That is why we have a great High Priest who has gone to heaven, Jesus the Son of God. Let us cling to him and never stop trusting him.', 'NLT'),
(59, 4, 15, 'This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses, for he faced all of the same temptations we do, yet he did not sin.', 'NLT'),
(59, 4, 16, 'So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive his mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it.', 'NLT'),
(59, 5, 1, 'Now a high priest is a man chosen to represent other human beings in their dealings with God. He presents their gifts to God and offers their sacrifices for sins.', 'NLT'),
(59, 5, 2, 'And because he is human, he is able to deal gently with the people, though they are ignorant and wayward. For he is subject to the same weaknesses they have.', 'NLT'),
(59, 5, 3, 'That is why he has to offer sacrifices, both for their sins and for his own sins.', 'NLT'),
(59, 5, 4, 'And no one can become a high priest simply because he wants such an honor. He has to be called by God for this work, just as Aaron was.', 'NLT'),
(59, 5, 5, 'That is why Christ did not exalt himself to become High Priest. No, he was chosen by God, who said to him, "You are my Son. Today I have become your Father. "', 'NLT'),
(59, 5, 6, 'And in another passage God said to him, "You are a priest forever in the line of Melchizedek."', 'NLT'),
(59, 5, 7, 'While Jesus was here on earth, he offered prayers and pleadings, with a loud cry and tears, to the one who could deliver him out of death. And God heard his prayers because of his reverence for God.', 'NLT'),
(59, 5, 8, 'So even though Jesus was God''s Son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered.', 'NLT'),
(59, 5, 9, 'In this way, God qualified him as a perfect High Priest, and he became the source of eternal salvation for all those who obey him.', 'NLT'),
(59, 5, 10, 'And God designated him to be a High Priest in the line of Melchizedek.', 'NLT'),
(59, 5, 11, 'There is so much more we would like to say about this. But you don''t seem to listen, so it''s hard to make you understand.', 'NLT'),
(59, 5, 12, 'You have been Christians a long time now, and you ought to be teaching others. Instead, you need someone to teach you again the basic things a beginner must learn about the Scriptures. You are like babies who drink only milk and cannot eat solid food.', 'NLT'),
(59, 5, 13, 'And a person who is living on milk isn''t very far along in the Christian life and doesn''t know much about doing what is right.', 'NLT'),
(59, 5, 14, 'Solid food is for those who are mature, who have trained themselves to recognize the difference between right and wrong and then do what is right.', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 1, 'So let us stop going over the basics of Christianity again and again. Let us go on instead and become mature in our understanding. Surely we don''t need to start all over again with the importance of turning away from evil deeds and placing our faith in God.', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 2, 'You don''t need further instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 3, 'And so, God willing, we will move forward to further understanding.', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 4, 'For it is impossible to restore to repentance those who were once enlightened--those who have experienced the good things of heaven and shared in the Holy Spirit,', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 5, 'who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the power of the age to come--', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 6, 'and who then turn away from God. It is impossible to bring such people to repentance again because they are nailing the Son of God to the cross again by rejecting him, holding him up to public shame.', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 7, 'When the ground soaks up the rain that falls on it and bears a good crop for the farmer, it has the blessing of God.', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 8, 'But if a field bears thistles and thorns, it is useless. The farmer will condemn that field and burn it.', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 9, 'Dear friends, even though we are talking like this, we really don''t believe that it applies to you. We are confident that you are meant for better things, things that come with salvation.', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 10, 'For God is not unfair. He will not forget how hard you have worked for him and how you have shown your love to him by caring for other Christians, as you still do.', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 11, 'Our great desire is that you will keep right on loving others as long as life lasts, in order to make certain that what you hope for will come true.', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 12, 'Then you will not become spiritually dull and indifferent. Instead, you will follow the example of those who are going to inherit God''s promises because of their faith and patience.', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 13, 'For example, there was God''s promise to Abraham. Since there was no one greater to swear by, God took an oath in his own name, saying:', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 14, '"I will certainly bless you richly, and I will multiply your descendants into countless millions."', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 15, 'Then Abraham waited patiently, and he received what God had promised.', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 16, 'When people take an oath, they call on someone greater than themselves to hold them to it. And without any question that oath is binding.', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 17, 'God also bound himself with an oath, so that those who received the promise could be perfectly sure that he would never change his mind.', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 18, 'So God has given us both his promise and his oath. These two things are unchangeable because it is impossible for God to lie. Therefore, we who have fled to him for refuge can take new courage, for we can hold on to his promise with confidence.', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 19, 'This confidence is like a strong and trustworthy anchor for our souls. It leads us through the curtain of heaven into God''s inner sanctuary.', 'NLT'),
(59, 6, 20, 'Jesus has already gone in there for us. He has become our eternal High Priest in the line of Melchizedek.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 1, 'This Melchizedek was king of the city of Salem and also a priest of God Most High. When Abraham was returning home after winning a great battle against many kings, Melchizedek met him and blessed him.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 2, 'Then Abraham took a tenth of all he had won in the battle and gave it to Melchizedek. His name means "king of justice." He is also "king of peace" because Salem means "peace."', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 3, 'There is no record of his father or mother or any of his ancestors--no beginning or end to his life. He remains a priest forever, resembling the Son of God.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 4, 'Consider then how great this Melchizedek was. Even Abraham, the great patriarch of Israel, recognized how great Melchizedek was by giving him a tenth of what he had taken in battle.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 5, 'Now the priests, who are descendants of Levi, are commanded in the law of Moses to collect a tithe from all the people, even though they are their own relatives.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 6, 'But Melchizedek, who was not even related to Levi, collected a tenth from Abraham. And Melchizedek placed a blessing upon Abraham, the one who had already received the promises of God.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 7, 'And without question, the person who has the power to bless is always greater than the person who is blessed.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 8, 'In the case of Jewish priests, tithes are paid to men who will die. But Melchizedek is greater than they are, because we are told that he lives on.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 9, 'In addition, we might even say that Levi''s descendants, the ones who collect the tithe, paid a tithe to Melchizedek through their ancestor Abraham.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 10, 'For although Levi wasn''t born yet, the seed from which he came was in Abraham''s loins when Melchizedek collected the tithe from him.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 11, 'And finally, if the priesthood of Levi could have achieved God''s purposes--and it was that priesthood on which the law was based--why did God need to send a different priest from the line of Melchizedek, instead of from the line of Levi and Aaron?', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 12, 'And when the priesthood is changed, the law must also be changed to permit it.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 13, 'For the one we are talking about belongs to a different tribe, whose members do not serve at the altar.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 14, 'What I mean is, our Lord came from the tribe of Judah, and Moses never mentioned Judah in connection with the priesthood.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 15, 'The change in God''s law is even more evident from the fact that a different priest, who is like Melchizedek, has now come.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 16, 'He became a priest, not by meeting the old requirement of belonging to the tribe of Levi, but by the power of a life that cannot be destroyed.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 17, 'And the psalmist pointed this out when he said of Christ, "You are a priest forever in the line of Melchizedek."', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 18, 'Yes, the old requirement about the priesthood was set aside because it was weak and useless.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 19, 'For the law made nothing perfect, and now a better hope has taken its place. And that is how we draw near to God.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 20, 'God took an oath that Christ would always be a priest, but he never did this for any other priest.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 21, 'Only to Jesus did he say, "The Lord has taken an oath and will not break his vow: ''You are a priest forever.''"', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 22, 'Because of God''s oath, it is Jesus who guarantees the effectiveness of this better covenant.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 23, 'Another difference is that there were many priests under the old system. When one priest died, another had to take his place.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 24, 'But Jesus remains a priest forever; his priesthood will never end.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 25, 'Therefore he is able, once and forever, to save everyone who comes to God through him. He lives forever to plead with God on their behalf.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 26, 'He is the kind of high priest we need because he is holy and blameless, unstained by sin. He has now been set apart from sinners, and he has been given the highest place of honor in heaven.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 27, 'He does not need to offer sacrifices every day like the other high priests. They did this for their own sins first and then for the sins of the people. But Jesus did this once for all when he sacrificed himself on the cross.', 'NLT'),
(59, 7, 28, 'Those who were high priests under the law of Moses were limited by human weakness. But after the law was given, God appointed his Son with an oath, and his Son has been made perfect forever.', 'NLT'),
(59, 8, 1, 'Here is the main point: Our High Priest sat down in the place of highest honor in heaven, at God''s right hand.', 'NLT'),
(59, 8, 2, 'There he ministers in the sacred tent, the true place of worship that was built by the Lord and not by human hands.', 'NLT'),
(59, 8, 3, 'And since every high priest is required to offer gifts and sacrifices, our High Priest must make an offering, too.', 'NLT'),
(59, 8, 4, 'If he were here on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there already are priests who offer the gifts required by the law of Moses.', 'NLT'),
(59, 8, 5, 'They serve in a place of worship that is only a copy, a shadow of the real one in heaven. For when Moses was getting ready to build the Tabernacle, God gave him this warning: "Be sure that you make everything according to the design I have shown you here on the mountain."', 'NLT'),
(59, 8, 6, 'But our High Priest has been given a ministry that is far superior to the ministry of those who serve under the old laws, for he is the one who guarantees for us a better covenant with God, based on better promises.', 'NLT'),
(59, 8, 7, 'If the first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second covenant to replace it.', 'NLT'),
(59, 8, 8, 'But God himself found fault with the old one when he said: "The day will come, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah.', 'NLT'),
(59, 8, 9, 'This covenant will not be like the one I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand and led them out of the land of Egypt. They did not remain faithful to my covenant, so I turned my back on them, says the Lord.', 'NLT'),
(59, 8, 10, 'But this is the new covenant I will make with the people of Israel on that day, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their minds so they will understand them, and I will write them on their hearts so they will obey them. I will be their God, and they will be my people.', 'NLT'),
(59, 8, 11, 'And they will not need to teach their neighbors, nor will they need to teach their family, saying, ''You should know the Lord.'' For everyone, from the least to the greatest, will already know me.', 'NLT'),
(59, 8, 12, 'And I will forgive their wrongdoings, and I will never again remember their sins."', 'NLT'),
(59, 8, 13, 'When God speaks of a new covenant, it means he has made the first one obsolete. It is now out of date and ready to be put aside.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 1, 'Now in that first covenant between God and Israel, there were regulations for worship and a sacred tent here on earth.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 2, 'There were two rooms in this tent. In the first room were a lampstand, a table, and loaves of holy bread on the table. This was called the Holy Place.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 3, 'Then there was a curtain, and behind the curtain was the second room called the Most Holy Place.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 4, 'In that room were a gold incense altar and a wooden chest called the Ark of the Covenant, which was covered with gold on all sides. Inside the Ark were a gold jar containing some manna, Aaron''s staff that sprouted leaves, and the stone tablets of the covenant with the Ten Commandments written on them.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 5, 'The glorious cherubim were above the Ark. Their wings were stretched out over the Ark''s cover, the place of atonement. But we cannot explain all of these things now.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 6, 'When these things were all in place, the priests went in and out of the first room regularly as they performed their religious duties.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 7, 'But only the high priest goes into the Most Holy Place, and only once a year, and always with blood, which he offers to God to cover his own sins and the sins the people have committed in ignorance.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 8, 'By these regulations the Holy Spirit revealed that the Most Holy Place was not open to the people as long as the first room and the entire system it represents were still in use.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 9, 'This is an illustration pointing to the present time. For the gifts and sacrifices that the priests offer are not able to cleanse the consciences of the people who bring them.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 10, 'For that old system deals only with food and drink and ritual washing--external regulations that are in effect only until their limitations can be corrected.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 11, 'So Christ has now become the High Priest over all the good things that have come. He has entered that great, perfect sanctuary in heaven, not made by human hands and not part of this created world.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 12, 'Once for all time he took blood into that Most Holy Place, but not the blood of goats and calves. He took his own blood, and with it he secured our salvation forever.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 13, 'Under the old system, the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow could cleanse people''s bodies from ritual defilement.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 14, 'Just think how much more the blood of Christ will purify our hearts from deeds that lead to death so that we can worship the living God. For by the power of the eternal Spirit, Christ offered himself to God as a perfect sacrifice for our sins.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 15, 'That is why he is the one who mediates the new covenant between God and people, so that all who are invited can receive the eternal inheritance God has promised them. For Christ died to set them free from the penalty of the sins they had committed under that first covenant.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 16, 'Now when someone dies and leaves a will, no one gets anything until it is proved that the person who wrote the will is dead.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 17, 'The will goes into effect only after the death of the person who wrote it. While the person is still alive, no one can use the will to get any of the things promised to them.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 18, 'That is why blood was required under the first covenant as a proof of death.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 19, 'For after Moses had given the people all of God''s laws, he took the blood of calves and goats, along with water, and sprinkled both the book of God''s laws and all the people, using branches of hyssop bushes and scarlet wool.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 20, 'Then he said, "This blood confirms the covenant God has made with you."', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 21, 'And in the same way, he sprinkled blood on the sacred tent and on everything used for worship.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 22, 'In fact, we can say that according to the law of Moses, nearly everything was purified by sprinkling with blood. Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 23, 'That is why the earthly tent and everything in it--which were copies of things in heaven--had to be purified by the blood of animals. But the real things in heaven had to be purified with far better sacrifices than the blood of animals.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 24, 'For Christ has entered into heaven itself to appear now before God as our Advocate. He did not go into the earthly place of worship, for that was merely a copy of the real Temple in heaven.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 25, 'Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, like the earthly high priest who enters the Most Holy Place year after year to offer the blood of an animal.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 26, 'If that had been necessary, he would have had to die again and again, ever since the world began. But no! He came once for all time, at the end of the age, to remove the power of sin forever by his sacrificial death for us.', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 27, 'And just as it is destined that each person dies only once and after that comes judgment,', 'NLT'),
(59, 9, 28, 'so also Christ died only once as a sacrifice to take away the sins of many people. He will come again but not to deal with our sins again. This time he will bring salvation to all those who are eagerly waiting for him.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 1, 'The old system in the law of Moses was only a shadow of the things to come, not the reality of the good things Christ has done for us. The sacrifices under the old system were repeated again and again, year after year, but they were never able to provide perfect cleansing for those who came to worship.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 2, 'If they could have provided perfect cleansing, the sacrifices would have stopped, for the worshipers would have been purified once for all time, and their feelings of guilt would have disappeared.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 3, 'But just the opposite happened. Those yearly sacrifices reminded them of their sins year after year.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 4, 'For it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 5, 'That is why Christ, when he came into the world, said, "You did not want animal sacrifices and grain offerings. But you have given me a body so that I may obey you.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 6, 'No, you were not pleased with animals burned on the altar or with other offerings for sin.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 7, 'Then I said, ''Look, I have come to do your will, O God--just as it is written about me in the Scriptures.''"', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 8, 'Christ said, "You did not want animal sacrifices or grain offerings or animals burned on the altar or other offerings for sin, nor were you pleased with them" (though they are required by the law of Moses).', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 9, 'Then he added, "Look, I have come to do your will." He cancels the first covenant in order to establish the second.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 10, 'And what God wants is for us to be made holy by the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 11, 'Under the old covenant, the priest stands before the altar day after day, offering sacrifices that can never take away sins.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 12, 'But our High Priest offered himself to God as one sacrifice for sins, good for all time. Then he sat down at the place of highest honor at God''s right hand.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 13, 'There he waits until his enemies are humbled as a footstool under his feet.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 14, 'For by that one offering he perfected forever all those whom he is making holy.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 15, 'And the Holy Spirit also testifies that this is so. First he says,', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 16, '"This is the new covenant I will make with my people on that day, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their hearts so they will understand them, and I will write them on their minds so they will obey them."', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 17, 'Then he adds, "I will never again remember their sins and lawless deeds."', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 18, 'Now when sins have been forgiven, there is no need to offer any more sacrifices.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 19, 'And so, dear brothers and sisters, we can boldly enter heaven''s Most Holy Place because of the blood of Jesus.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 20, 'This is the new, life-giving way that Christ has opened up for us through the sacred curtain, by means of his death for us.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 21, 'And since we have a great High Priest who rules over God''s people,', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 22, 'let us go right into the presence of God, with true hearts fully trusting him. For our evil consciences have been sprinkled with Christ''s blood to make us clean, and our bodies have been washed with pure water.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 23, 'Without wavering, let us hold tightly to the hope we say we have, for God can be trusted to keep his promise.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 24, 'Think of ways to encourage one another to outbursts of love and good deeds.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 25, 'And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people do, but encourage and warn each other, especially now that the day of his coming back again is drawing near.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 26, 'Dear friends, if we deliberately continue sinning after we have received a full knowledge of the truth, there is no other sacrifice that will cover these sins.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 27, 'There will be nothing to look forward to but the terrible expectation of God''s judgment and the raging fire that will consume his enemies.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 28, 'Anyone who refused to obey the law of Moses was put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.', 'NLT'),
(59, 10, 29, 'Think how much more terrible the punishment will be for those who have trampled on the Son of God and have treated the blood of the covenant as if it were common and unholy. Such people have insulted and enraged the Holy Spirit who brings God''s mercy to his people.', 'NLT'),
