(15, 8, 63, 'Solomon sacrificed peace offerings to the LORD numbering 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. And so the king and all Israel dedicated the Temple of the LORD.', 'NLT'),
(15, 8, 64, 'That same day the king dedicated the central area of the courtyard in front of the LORD''s Temple. He offered burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat of peace offerings there, because the bronze altar in the LORD''s presence was too small to handle so many offerings.', 'NLT'),
(15, 8, 65, 'Then Solomon and all Israel celebrated the Festival of Shelters in the presence of the LORD their God.

(15, 9, 6, '"But if you or your descendants abandon me and disobey my commands and laws, and if you go and worship other gods,', 'NLT'),
(15, 9, 7, 'then I will uproot the people of Israel from this land I have given them. I will reject this Temple that I have set apart to honor my name. I will make Israel an object of mockery and ridicule among the nations.', 'NLT'),
(15, 9, 8, 'And though this Temple is impressive now, it will become an appalling sight for all who pass by. They will scoff and ask, `Why did the LORD do such terrible things to his land and to his Temple?''', 'NLT'),
(15, 9, 9, 'And the answer will be, `Because his people forgot the LORD their God, who brought their ancestors out of Egypt, and they worshiped other gods instead. That is why the LORD has brought all these disasters upon them.''"', 'NLT'),
(15, 9, 10, 'Now at the end of the twenty years during which Solomon built the Temple of the LORD and the royal palace,', 'NLT'),
(15, 9, 11, 'Solomon gave twenty towns in the land of Galilee to King Hiram of Tyre as payment for all the cedar and cypress lumber and gold he had furnished for the construction of the buildings.', 'NLT'),

(15, 9, 18, 'Baalath, and Tamar in the desert, within his land.', 'NLT'),
(15, 9, 19, 'He built towns as supply centers and constructed cities where his chariots and horses could be kept. He built to his heart''s content in Jerusalem and Lebanon and throughout the entire realm.', 'NLT'),

(15, 9, 21, 'These were descendants of the nations that Israel had not completely destroyed. So Solomon conscripted them for his labor force, and they serve in the labor force to this day.', 'NLT'),
(15, 9, 22, 'But Solomon did not conscript any of the Israelites for forced labor. Instead, he assigned them to serve as fighting men, government officials, officers in his army, commanders of his chariots, and charioteers.', 'NLT'),
(15, 9, 23, 'He also appointed 550 of them to supervise the various projects.', 'NLT'),
(15, 9, 24, 'After Solomon moved his wife, Pharaoh''s daughter, from the City of David to the new palace he had built for her, he constructed the Millo.', 'NLT'),

(15, 10, 3, 'Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too hard for the king to explain to her.', 'NLT'),
(15, 10, 4, 'When the queen of Sheba realized how wise Solomon was, and when she saw the palace he had built,', 'NLT'),
(15, 10, 5, 'she was breathless. She was also amazed at the food on his tables, the organization of his officials and their splendid clothing, the cup-bearers and their robes, and the burnt offerings Solomon made at the Temple of the LORD.', 'NLT'),
(15, 10, 6, 'She exclaimed to the king, "Everything I heard in my country about your achievements and wisdom is true!', 'NLT'),
(15, 10, 7, 'I didn''t believe it until I arrived here and saw it with my own eyes. Truly I had not heard the half of it! Your wisdom and prosperity are far greater than what I was told.', 'NLT'),
(15, 10, 8, 'How happy these people must be! What a privilege for your officials to stand here day after day, listening to your wisdom!', 'NLT'),
(15, 10, 9, 'The LORD your God is great indeed! He delights in you and has placed you on the throne of Israel. Because the LORD loves Israel with an eternal love, he has made you king so you can rule with justice and righteousness."', 'NLT'),
(15, 10, 10, 'Then she gave the king a gift of nine thousand pounds of gold, and great quantities of spices and precious jewels. Never again were so many spices brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to Solomon.', 'NLT'),

(15, 10, 13, 'King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba whatever she asked for, besides all the other customary gifts he had so generously given. Then she and all her attendants left and returned to their own land.', 'NLT'),
(15, 10, 14, 'Each year Solomon received about twenty-five tons of gold.', 'NLT'),

(15, 10, 18, 'Then the king made a huge ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold.', 'NLT'),
(15, 10, 19, 'The throne had six steps and a rounded back. On both sides of the seat were armrests, with the figure of a lion standing on each side of the throne.', 'NLT'),
(15, 10, 20, 'Solomon made twelve other lion figures, one standing on each end of each of the six steps. No other throne in all the world could be compared with it!', 'NLT'),
(15, 10, 21, 'All of King Solomon''s drinking cups were solid gold, as were all the utensils in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. They were not made of silver because silver was considered of little value in Solomon''s day!', 'NLT'),

(15, 10, 29, 'At that time, Egyptian chariots delivered to Jerusalem could be purchased for 600 pieces of silver, and horses could be bought for 150 pieces of silver. Many of these were then resold to the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.', 'NLT'),
(15, 11, 1, 'Now King Solomon loved many foreign women. Besides Pharaoh''s daughter, he married women from Moab, Ammon, Edom, Sidon, and from among the Hittites.', 'NLT'),
(15, 11, 2, 'The LORD had clearly instructed his people not to intermarry with those nations, because the women they married would lead them to worship their gods. Yet Solomon insisted on loving them anyway.', 'NLT'),
(15, 11, 3, 'He had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines. And sure enough, they led his heart away from the LORD.', 'NLT'),

(15, 11, 5, 'Solomon worshiped Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molech, the detestable god of the Ammonites.', 'NLT'),

(15, 11, 10, 'He had warned Solomon specifically about worshiping other gods, but Solomon did not listen to the LORD''s command.', 'NLT'),
(15, 11, 11, 'So now the LORD said to him, "Since you have not kept my covenant and have disobeyed my laws, I will surely tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your servants.', 'NLT'),
(15, 11, 12, 'But for the sake of your father, David, I will not do this while you are still alive. I will take the kingdom away from your son.', 'NLT'),
