(44, 27, 1, 'Very early in the morning, the leading priests and other leaders met again to discuss how to persuade the Roman government to sentence Jesus to death.', 'NLT'),

(44, 27, 4, '"I have sinned," he declared, "for I have betrayed an innocent man.What do we care?" they retorted. "That''s your problem."', 'NLT'),
(44, 27, 5, 'Then Judas threw the money onto the floor of the Temple and went out and hanged himself.', 'NLT'),
(44, 27, 6, 'The leading priests picked up the money. "We can''t put it in the Temple treasury," they said, "since it''s against the law to accept money paid for murder."', 'NLT'),

(44, 27, 24, 'Pilate saw that he wasn''t getting anywhere and that a riot was developing. So he sent for a bowl of water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this man. The responsibility is yours!"', 'NLT'),
(44, 27, 25, 'And all the people yelled back, "We will take responsibility for his death--we and our children!"', 'NLT'),
