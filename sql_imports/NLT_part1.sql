(1, 4, 3, 'At harvesttime Cain brought to the LORD a gift of his farm produce,', 'NLT'),
(1, 4, 4, 'while Abel brought several choice lambs from the best of his flock. The LORD accepted Abel and his offering,', 'NLT'),
(1, 4, 5, 'but he did not accept Cain and his offering. This made Cain very angry and dejected.', 'NLT'),
